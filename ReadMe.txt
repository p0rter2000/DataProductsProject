Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

Model fitting with polynomials
-Random cubic data was generated
-Noise was added to the y variable
-The data is then fit with a model, where the order of the polynomial (poly_ord) is user selectable.

Model Evaluation
- Summary of model given in table.
- R Squared valued displayed.
- User can imput a value and a predicted value is returned.
